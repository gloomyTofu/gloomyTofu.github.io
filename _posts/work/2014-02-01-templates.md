## WORKFLOW

At Cobalt/ADP, now referred to as CDK, I was part of the digital marketing team PowerBrand. It was a new product line and orders were coming in at a rapid pace. Work required a balance of graphic design skills and front-end markup. Some were good at front-end while others were more suited for designing. Production was intense. Our queue was increasing by the hundreds but deadlines remained fixed.  

<div class="screenshot-container">
	<img src="/assets/images/work/{{page.folder}}/preview.jpg 1x" srcset="/assets/images/work/{{page.folder}}/preview@2x.jpg 2x" alt="Wireframe" />
</div>

As the HTML/CSS technical lead, I served as the 'go-to' for any build questions. When production was slow, I would use the time to optimize our existing templates. These were desktop and mobile boilerplates that designers and developers would use and then reuse for each campaign. My goal was to make these templates as clean and as flexible as possible.

With the help and feedback from the team, the new boilerplates were a huge success. The team appreciated the new layouts and the ongoing revisions and improvements. Even though orders kept coming, we still managed to make our deadlines. Though the work tends to be siloed, I loved how we all came together to solve workflow issues.
