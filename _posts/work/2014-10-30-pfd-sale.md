## RESPONSIVE + ADAPTIVE

Responsive sale page for Alaska Airlines. I worked for the Seattle based company as a contract Front-End Designer and Developer. 

The PFD Sale was an annual sale for customers in the state of Alaska.  Alaska Airlines wanted to A/B test conversions on a responsive versus a non-responsive page. Problem? The ecommerce site wasn't built with a responsive layout.  Despite this, if the test proved successful, it would reenforce the need for an updated, modern framework.
