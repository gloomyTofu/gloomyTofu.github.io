## STREET FOOD GUIDE

Snack Street was my Final Thesis project for my Masters in Web Design and New Media.

There are plenty of travel, food, and review apps available like Yelp and TripAdvisor. Those apps are great to help users decide *where* to eat but rarely do we see a guide about *what* to eat. The Snack Street app identifies local, authentic dishes specific to a country of region. No more wondering what a dish is and whether its safe to eat. Snack Street will provide all the information travelers need. Allowing users to spend more time enjoying their trip and less time researching.
